- Monitoring.ino file is created and it has been used store the setup function and the looping function for the IoT module. 
The Monitoring.ino file is the main file that contains the constraints for each of the sensor's thresholds value.
I used to control flow to limit the threshold value for each of the sensor

- In global.h file, I included the SoftwareSerial library to define the communication channel between Arduino and the sensor.

- I created a gsm.h file to define the gsm module.
